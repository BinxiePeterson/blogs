Hi there! I'm Bianca Peterson, a Data Scientist at Fathom Data. I have a passion for managing projects, teaching computational skills and analysing data.

If you have a project that you want to get started or would like to get training in data analysis, visualisation and report writing, get in touch.

You can read more about my work \[here\](https://binxiepeterson.github.io/).
